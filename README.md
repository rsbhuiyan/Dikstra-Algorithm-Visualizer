# Dijkstra-Algorithm-Visualizer
A pathfinding visualizer for the Dijkstra's Algorithm using a React and JavaScript.
It allows for a start node and end node in a grid and once the "Visualize Dijkstra's Algorithm" button is pressed you will be able to see how the algorihtm will search for the end node as well as highlight the quickest path to the end node.
The program also allows you to insert walls among the grid allowing Dijkkstra's Algorithm to find unique solutions to get to the end node.
